This repo holds a stock vagrant implementation for use in consulting engagements.

In the rollup, I have:

CentOS Linux 7<br>
Puppet Master with Puppet Enterprise 3.8.0<br>
Puppet Agents 1-3, all customized to the following three environments:<br>
- development<br>
- testing<br>
- production<br>

REQUIRED:
To use this module with your current Vagrant Implementation, you have to install two vagrant plugins:
- vagrant-hosts<br>
- vagrant-pe_build<br>

To install the required plugins, on your local system simply run:

vagrant plugin install vagrant-hosts<br>
vagrant plugin install vagrant-pe_build<br>

to prepare Vagrant to use the included Vagrantfile.

NOTES:

Because of GitHub's copious use of "master" as the default branch, you end up with a "master" 
branch & directory environment.  Puppet Labs' documentation states that "master" is a reserved
word, and cannot be used as an environment name.  So, you should refrain from using this 
environment.  I plan on removing it in future versions of this module, I just have to do 
development in-between professional services engagements.

With the default installaiton of PE 3.8.0, r10k now comes installed by default.  Old steps taken
to remediate the production directory and do an initial r10k run are no longer necessary. 

Linux testing is now complete.  After a professional services engagement recently, I had a 
number of students need to use the instance who were all Linux users, and they were able to
"fire test" for me.  Issues, if any, should be opened on the project in the GitHub page.


TODO:
- VMWare Fusion Support
  - I have one pull request on VMWare Fusion, and it's a hacky sort of substitute,
    If anyone nows how to get the Vagrantfile to determine the right virtualization
    technology and just "do the right thing" all in one Vagrantfile, that's the 
    "silver bullet" I'm looking for.
- Git Server based locally and master pointed to Git
- Sometimes the vagrant package will not download the Puppet Enterprise properly.  Needs resolution.
- Look into removing the master branch, and only have "development, testing, and production" branches.
